🔍 Credit Card Fraud Detection

A machine learning project focused on identifying fraudulent credit card transactions using real-world anonymized data. This project applies classification techniques to detect fraudulent behavior from highly imbalanced datasets.

📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to:
	•	Identify fraudulent transactions using machine learning.
	•	Handle data imbalance effectively using techniques like undersampling or SMOTE.
	•	Evaluate model performance using precision-recall metrics, which are more informative in imbalanced datasets.
	•	Build, tune, and compare multiple classification algorithms.

📂 Dataset
	•	Source: (e.g., Kaggle - Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset)
	•	Description: Contains transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013. Features are anonymized (V1–V28), plus:
	•	Time
	•	Amount
	•	Class: 1 = fraud, 0 = normal

📊 Tools and Libraries Used
	•	Python 🐍
	•	NumPy, Pandas
	•	Matplotlib, Seaborn (for EDA)
	•	Scikit-learn (ML models and evaluation)
	•	Imbalanced-learn (for resampling)
	•	Jupyter Notebook

⚙️ Workflow
	1.	Data Exploration – Check class distribution, correlation, and feature patterns.
	2.	Preprocessing – Scaling features, handling imbalanced data.
	3.	Model Training – Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.
	4.	Evaluation Metrics – Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC.
	5.	Cross-validation and Hyperparameter Tuning – Use of GridSearchCV.

⚠️ Challenges Addressed
	•	Imbalanced Data: Fraud cases are <1% of all transactions.
	•	Precision vs. Recall Trade-off: Avoiding false negatives is critical.

✅ Results
	•	Best model: (e.g., Logistic Regression with balanced class weight)
